<h2>Three Nights in the Woods</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
<p>I do realize the game shares some (unintentional) similarities with games like Don't Starve and Slender: The Eight Pages (which I have not played) mostly that it is a survival game with horror elements.</p>
<p>However, I do believe my "stealth" mechanic makes it somewhat unique.</p>
<p>The rather quick pace of gameplay and short nature also makes it stand out somewhat.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
  <li>For this game I used a free program called Tiled to create the tilemaps and generate a tilemap JSON for phaser.</li>
  <li>I think I'm getting better at setting up maps.</li>
  <li>This is the first game I've made with multiple turns and multiple lose conditions.</li>
  <li>The game also has simple primary and secondary goals.</li>
  <li>Unlike my other games the player has more than a few elements to keep track of.</li>
  <li>Also unlike my other games there is a simplistic ramping difficulty.</li>
  <li>Simple "stealth" mechanic</li>
  <li>I like the animated menu screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li>The easiest (and most fun) part was creating the assets.</li>
<li>The hardest part was time management (I think I spent too much time on creating the assets).</li>
<li>I'm still getting used to Phaser.</li>
</ul>
